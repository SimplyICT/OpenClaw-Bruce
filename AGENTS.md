# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

## The Asgardian Defense Team

- **Bruce (Orchestrator):** Primary assistant, managing workloads and multi-agent synergy.

## 🚨 CONTINUITY & PERSISTENCE PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
To prevent data loss from session crashes, every task MUST follow this strict sequence before providing the final reply to David:

1. **Perform the Task.**
2. **Update Dedicated Memory:** Write a summary of the action, findings, and context to your file in `/data/workspace/memory/agents/<YourName>.md`.
3. **Log to Database:** Execute `python3 /data/workspace/logger.py` to update the Supabase telemetry dashboard.
4. **Sync to GitHub:** Bruce (Orchestrator) or the acting agent must stage, commit, and push the workspace changes to ensure remote safety.

**Wait for confirmation of all four (Task, Memory, DB, GitHub) before the final response.**

## Red Lines
- Don't exfiltrate private data.
- Don't run destructive commands without asking.
- **NEVER modify `openclaw.json` (the core system configuration) without explicit user permission and a verified backup.**
- `trash` > `rm`.
